# Hierholzer-s-algorithm-implementation-for-directed-graphs-

Hierholzer's algorithm is used to identify whether a directed graph contains 'a_ Euler circuit_ or a _Euler path_' or not.\
**hierholzersalgo.py** has hardcoded values of vertices and edges for definition of a directed graph.\
If euler circuit or euler path exists, prints the circuit or path respectively.
